                <p>Deep Breathing is an excellent way to treat stress and anxiety. This chrome extension was built to help guide you through deep breathing. Deep breathing should be done by breathing in through the nose, and out through the mouth. Enter the type of deep breathing exercise you would like to do, and how many breath repetitions you would like to do, and follow the instructions. Enjoy!</p>
